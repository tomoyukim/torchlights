# Torchlights

A real-time collaborating particle system with multiple users using socket.io and p5.js

## What's this

This is an experimental application to create a place where anonymous users can access and interact each other in real time.

The application was created and deployed since 2014 at
[https://torchilights.herokuapp.com/](https://torchlights.herokuapp.com/)

## Features

- User can control one particle on the application
- All user's particle can be shown each other
- Each user partile can have different color and size randomly

## Note

If only one user access the application, I noticed this is very bored :p
